Suppose you are given a SQL table containing the
brands of shoes (field name: brand) as well as the shoe price (field name: price). The database is
called shoe_info. You are tasked with updating the prices in this database for a few brands of shoes. Specifically,
you have been asked to update all Nike shoe prices to $100, and all Adidas shoe prices to
$85. Using SQL, write a query to perform this action.


Sln:

update shoe_info 
set price = 100
where brand = 'Nike'

update shoe_info
set price = 85
where brand = 'Adidas'
